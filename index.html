            <p>Forecast was made to allow new game developers to add weather to their game's world
                in a way that makes the weather impactful. The package is structured in a way to allow for
                maximum customizability when using the weather, but with the ability to work with it out of the box,
                making it as easy as possible for users of all experience levels to add weather that changes how the
                world they've made interacts.

            <h1>Cube Navigator</h1>

            <a href="https://github.com/BardsSong/Forecast-Base">Link to the Repo</a>
            <p>Cube Navigator was a project made to learn level design when working with a specific gimmick to the level
                in this case, being able to rotate the level so that you can see more of the space that you need to work through.
                This game also had a focus on polishing the game in it's entirety to make a completed game feel.
